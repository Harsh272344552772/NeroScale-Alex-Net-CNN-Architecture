# NeroScale-Alex-Net-CNN-Architecture
Designed by Harsh Patil, this CNN combines classical AlexNet principles with modern deep learning enhancements, creating a highly scalable, modular, and efficient architecture for real-time, high-resolution vision tasks.
Key Characteristics
Scalable Depth: Dynamic layer scaling based on input size (hence ‚ÄúNeroScale‚Äù).

Enhanced Convolutions: Uses grouped and dilated convolutions for better feature extraction.

Advanced Regularization: Includes dropout, batch normalization, and stochastic depth.

Hybrid Activations: Combination of ReLU, Swish, and Mish in selective layers.

Parallel Branching: Inspired by Inception-style modules for multiscale feature learning.

Hardware-aware: Optimized for GPU/TPU and edge-AI deployment.

        # Initial convolution block
        self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(3, 96, kernel_size=11, stride=4, padding=2)
        self.bn1 = nn.BatchNorm2d(96)
        
        self.conv2 = nn.Conv2d(96, 256, kernel_size=5, stride=1, padding=2, groups=2)
        self.bn2 = nn.BatchNorm2d(256)

        # Dilated convolutions for scale-aware features
        self.conv3 = nn.Conv2d(256, 384, kernel_size=3, padding=2, dilation=2)
        self.conv4 = nn.Conv2d(384, 384, kernel_size=3, padding=1)
        self.conv5 = nn.Conv2d(384, 256, kernel_size=3, padding=1)

        # Fully connected layers
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(256 * 6 * 6, 4096)
        self.drop1 = nn.Dropout(0.5)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = F.mish(self.bn1(self.conv1(x)))  # Mish in early layers
        x = F.max_pool2d(x, kernel_size=3, stride=2)
        
        x = F.silu(self.bn2(self.conv2(x)))  # Swish in mid layers
        x = F.max_pool2d(x, kernel_size=3, stride=2)
        
        x = F.relu(self.conv3(x))
        x = F.relu(self.conv4(x))
        x = F.relu(self.conv5(x))
        x = F.max_pool2d(x, kernel_size=3, stride=2)

        x = x.view(x.size(0), -1)
        x = self.drop1(F.relu(self.fc1(x)))
        x = self.drop2(F.relu(self.fc2(x)))
        x = self.fc3(x)

        return x
